This project is a fork of Mozilla's MozBot.

"This is the source code for "mozbot", the IRC bot who hangs out in the
#mozilla channel at irc.mozilla.org."

More information about the orginal project:
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozbot

Forked from Mozilla's CVS by the following method:
$ cd /usr/local
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot
$ cvs login
CVS password: anonymous
$ git cvsimport -d $CVSROOT -C mozbot -r cvs -k mozilla/webtools/mozbot

Additional modules were imported from Patrick Connelly <patrick@deadlypenguin.com>.
